# My-Visualization-Principles

Qualities of Good Visualization:
   - Easy to understand and Memorable
   - Carries meaningful message
   - Clean and visually appealing

1. Color choice
   - CVD friendly
   - color schemes: sequential, divergent, categorical, highlight, alert
   - total vs partial: sequential color 
   - don't make colors too transparent or thin such that people cannot notice it 
   
2. Font
   - Style: Serif and Sanserif combination (title and subtitle)
   - Sanserif is in general better and more friendly than Serif because the latter looks too formal
   - Bold/Underline/Italic - don't use in combination.
   - All caps or not? almost always no.
   - Use of subtitle and caption
   
3. Grid
   - don't make gridlines too thick or have strong color
   
4. Title/Subtitle/Caption/Figure
   - caption: mention data source whenever possible

3. Numbers
  - Percentages vs Absolute
  - Rounding to significant digits
  
4. Line chart
  - y axis scale: 2/3 rule
  - y axis increments: use natural scale (e.g. 0-2-4-6, 0-5-10-15)
  - thickness of line: thicker than gridline, but thin to show twists and turns
  - setting baseline as zero or not
  - charting multiple time series: max 4
  - direct labeling instead of legends
  - use lighter or different color for projection
  
5. Bar Chart
   - no zebra pattern of color -> use lighted to darkest
   - No labeling at angle
   - prefer using direct labeling rather than using legends
   - always use zero baseline
   - use both absolute quantities and percentage changes
   - do not shadow, various shades, or 3-d the bars
   - for negative zone, use grey background
   - only use broken bar if there is a single outlier
   - for horizontal bar, left is negative and right is positive
   - always sort the bars from highest to lowest or alphabetically
   

8. Map
   - Showing a scale of values from low to high, use hexagon heatmap
   - When highlighting a change in a few states, use real map
